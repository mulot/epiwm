INSTALLATION
------------

Decompress the archive : 

	gunzip -c epiwm-0.5.6.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Enter in the directory, configure it and build it : 

	cd epiwm-0.5.6
	./configure
	make

If you want to disable the use of libXpm, add --disable-xpm to ./configure
If you want to disable the use of Imlib, add --disable-imlib to ./configure
You can specify where to install config files with the --sysconfdir=[PATH] option of configure.
see (./configure --help)

If you want to install EPIwm, you must be root and type: 

	make install-strip


If it does not work, you can try : 

	make -f Makefile.linux
	make -f Makefile.linux install


* RPM Install:
Be root and just type :

	rpm -ivh EPIwm-0.5.6-1.i386.rpm


* Deb Install:
Be root and just type :

	dpkg -i epiwm_0.5.6-1_i386.deb


Add this following line in your ~/.xinitrc or your ~/.xsession file :
	
	exec epiwm


It's finished. You can launch EPIwm.


THEME
_____

Decompress the theme in your ~/.epiwm directory : 

	tar xvfz EPIwm_be_theme.tar.gz

Now you have two directories : 

	$ ls ~/.epiwm
	$ be/ pixmaps/

Edit your .xinitrc file and add the line : 

	exec epiwm -theme ~/.epiwm/be

Now it's OK. So you can have several theme directories in your ~/.epiwm directory. And you can select the theme that you want with the -theme option of the epiwm
command.
